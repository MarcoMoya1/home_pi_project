# Home Security Camera Stream

A simple personal project to turn a Raspberry Pi and a USB webcam into a live-streaming home security camera, viewable through a clean web app.

## Overview

This project uses:
- A **Raspberry Pi** (tested on Pi 3B+) as the camera server
- A **USB webcam** for video capture
- A lightweight **Python + Flask + OpenCV** server to stream live MJPEG video
- A **Next.js/React** web app to display the live stream in a nice, responsive interface

The goal is a basic, private live view of my apartment that I can access from any device on my network (or remotely with a tunnel like ngrok).

Future ideas: Add motion detection, facial recognition, or recording — but for now, it's just a reliable live stream.

## Setup

### Raspberry Pi Side
1. Install Raspberry Pi OS (Lite recommended).
2. Connect your USB webcam.
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3-opencv python3-flask
